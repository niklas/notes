= Notes

<b>Stupidly grep tags in source code.</b>

(mirror from https://github.com/v0n/notes)

This gem provides a command line tool and a Ruby library to find tags in
source code. Defaults tags are *TODO*, *FIXME*, and *XXX*.
Custom tags can be found as well.

It's kind of a generic version of the Ruby on Rails <tt>rake notes</tt> command,
for any project/source.

== Command line tool

Usage:

    $ notes [options] [file...]

With no argument, <tt>notes</tt> will search recursively in the current
directory. For details, see <tt>notes --help</tt>.

Examples:

    $ notes
    $ notes foo.h src/
    $ notes --tag @@@
    $ notes --no-{todo,fixme,xxx} --tag FOO

=== Integration with Git

A cool thing to do is to add a Git alias to parse every versionned files:

    $ git config --global alias.n '!git ls-files | xargs notes'

Now, running <tt>git n</tt> in any Git repository will search
notes in every files under version control!

=== Convention over configuration

No custom output.

It uses a grep-style display, which makes it easy to fit your
needs. <tt>cut</tt> is great:

    $ notes | cut -d: -f3,4-

will display this:

    TODO:    /* add a cool feature */

instead of the normal output:

    foo.c:42:TODO:    /* add a cool feature */

And colors will still be displayed.

Notes won't filter.

<tt>find</tt>, <tt>xargs</tt> are your friends:

    $ find . -name '*.rb' | xargs notes

Or get the list of tagged files in the current directory with:

    $ notes | cut -d: -f1 | sort -u

== Installation

Notes is available on Rubygems.org[http://rubygems.org/gems/notes] and
can be installed with:

    $ [sudo] gem install notes

Or you can install from the source directory with:

    $ rake install

== The Notes library

The Notes module provides convenient methods.

    require 'notes'
    
    Notes.scan_file("foo.c") do |note|
      puts "#{note.tag} found at line #{note.line}!"
    end

Notes can also extend an object to add a new method (see Notes#notes),
or allow you to create your own scanner (see the Notes::Scanner).

For usage example of the library, you can have a look at the really basic
{Notes plugin}[http://github.com/v0n/redmine_notes] for Redmine, at:
